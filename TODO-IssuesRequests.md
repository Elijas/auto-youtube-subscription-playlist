# TODO

1. Auto-Delete the oldest video in the playlist when "limit is reached" exception is caught (didn't saw the need yet)
2. Improve code: make set up process quick and easy (release as an app?) (Google fixing [this Script bug](https://code.google.com/p/google-apps-script-issues/issues/detail?id=5188) would help a lot, even better [this bug](https://code.google.com/p/gdata-issues/issues/detail?id=3946) which would eliminate the need for gmail entirely)
